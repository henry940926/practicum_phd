# Background

### Background - Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)

- Newly named rare but serious complication during the COVID-19 pandemic (**temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 exposure**).

- Affected children presented with fever and nonspecific symptoms that include abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, and fatigue.

- Features are similar to those of **Kawasaki disease (KD)** and other inflammatory diseases.

### Research questions

- Aim to understand the underlying pathobiology and genetic factors that predispose children to MIS-C.

## Background - Approach

- A polygenic risk score (PRS) – aggregates the comprehensive structure of disease risk into one single entity.

- Utilize publicly available GWAS summary statistics for COVID-19 severity, Kawasaki disease (KD) and SJIA (Systemic Juvenile idiopathic arthritis). 

- Test the association between the constructed scores and MIS-C status to understand the disease spectrum and pathobiology.

## Methods - The study cohort

```{r, out.width='60%', out.height= '38%'}
include_graphics('../../references/figures/hostseq.png')
```

- MIS-C cohort (children (<18) from the Hostseq biobank)
    * 30 MIS-C positive (COVID positive) - cases
    * 92 MIS-C negative (COVID positive) - controls
    * Whole genome sequencing was done at SK TCAG facility.

## Methods - GWAS summary statistics considered

- COVID severity (hospitalization) (HGI release 5)

    * Meta-analysis from 46 studies over 19 countries 
  
    * 5,773 cases and 15,497 controls

- COVID severity (hospitalization) (HGI release 7)

    * Meta-analysis from 60+ studies from 25+ countries 

- Kawasaki disease (KD)

    * European ancestry
  
    * 400 cases and 6,101 controls
  
- Systemic Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA)
  
    * 9 geographically defined and ancestrally matched case-control

    * 770 cases and 6947 controls
  
# Updated results

## Results - Population stratification - PCA


```{r}
include_graphics('../../figures/pca/genomemisc_cpos/kd_clive/all/pcscatter.pdf')
```

## Results - Fitted model

1. For each PRS summary statistic, each p-value threshold, we

    * Fitted $PRS_i= \beta_0+\sum_{j=1}^{4}\beta_jPC_{ij}+\epsilon_i$ 

    * Output the residual $(\hat \epsilon_i)$ as a new variable $res(PRS)_i$

    * Fit the logistic regression $\text{logit}(p_{MIS-C})= \beta_0+\sum_{j=1}^{4}\beta_jPC_{ij}+\text{res}(PRS)_i$ 

2. Compared within the HGI releases

3. Compared between the PRSs

## Results - Variation explained comparison between r5 and r7 of HGI


```{r}
include_graphics('../../figures/prs/misc_cpos/hgi_compare/all/varexp_res.pdf')
```

## Results - Variation explained from different PRS

```{r}
include_graphics('../../figures/prs/misc_cpos/all/all/varexp_res.pdf')
```


## Results - Summary and limitations

- More robust estimates in the HGI summary statistics (r5 vs r7)  could result in higher variation explained in the PRS model.

- Significant association found between SJIA PRS and MIS-C status. No significant association found between the disease and other PRSs.

- This study can be statistically under-powered at this stage, and will utilize more Hostseq samples from other sites.


# Future work

- Pending Hostseq joint call

- Perform gene-based statistical tests on candidate genes from KD, COVID-19, SJIA, immunology and inflammatory pathways to help understand the disease mechanism.

- Apply other newly developed PRS methods for more robust estimations of the scores.
