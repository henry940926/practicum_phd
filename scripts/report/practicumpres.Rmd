# Introduction

## Background

- Previously undescribed systemic inflammatory condition **temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 exposure**. 

- Affected children presented with features similar to those of **Kawasaki disease (KD)**.

- Various nomenclature with differing case definitions have been proposed.

- Ongoing debate continues regarding whether MIS-C is similar or different from KD, and whether SARS-CoV-2 exposure triggers the disease phenotypes.

## MIS-C symptoms according to CDC

```{r,out.width='65%'}

```


## Research questions

- Are there genetic factors that predispose children to MIS-C?  

- Are the genetic factors that are associated with severe COVID also predispose to MIS-C? or COVID symptoms in children?

Approaches

- Using publicly available GWAS summary statistics from HGI analysis to construct PRS as a severity score. 

- Utilize SNPs from PRS and candidate genes in COVID & KD to test for genetic association with MIS-C.

- Testing the PRS in MIS-C and COVID children.





# Methods


## The study cohort

Prospective cohorts of children (<18) from the Hostseq biobank.

- MIS-C samples (N=43):

MIS-C diagnosed/suspected

- COVID+ samples (N=91):

COVID+ but not MIS-C

- Whole genome sequencing was done on 134 samples at SK TCAG facility.



## The HGI cohort 

::: columns

:::: column


- 3 case-control meta analyses + additional sensitivity analysis comparing *hospitalized COVID cases vs non-hospitalized COVID*.

- Other studies have shown that considering controls with higher exposure rate to SARS-CoV-2 could increase statistical power.

## Polygenic risk score (PRS) 

- A polygenic risk score (PRS) is an estimate of an individualâ€™s genetic liability to a trait, calculated according to:


$$PRS_i=\sum_{j=1}^{J} \hat \beta_j G_{ij}$$

- Sum of risk alleles that an individual has, weighted by the risk allele effect sizes as estimated by a GWAS.

- Base cohort & target cohort

## Polygenic risk score (PRS) calculation


- Two classical methods:

1. Shrinkage of GWAS effect size estimates

2. Controlling for Linkage disequilibrium (LD)

 a) Clumping - prioritizing SNPs at the locus with the smallest GWAS P value

 b) Thresholding - keeping SNPs with a p-value less than a certain limit 

## Single-SNP tests

- Candidate genes will be obtained from published GWAS studies for COVID and KD.

- After the clumping steps from generating PRS, remaining SNPs will be closer to linkage equilibrium.

- Remaining SNPs that are in the candidate genes will be tested with Bonferroni correction.



# Stage of work

## Stage of work


- Literature reviews on PRS methods.

- Working to compile the clinical data and the genetic data for the MIS-C and COVID+ cohorts.


- Gathering the data from HGI needed to construct the PRS.


- Will get the VCF for the sequencing data from the Hostseq project.
