## Background

Overview

- Three genome-wide association meta-analyses comprised of up to 49,562 COVID-19 patients and 2 million controls from 46 (Case-control) studies across 19 countries. 

Cohort

- Different genetic ancestries, including European, Admixed American, African, Middle Eastern, South Asian and East Asian individuals 

Controls

- Controls for all three analyses were selected as genetically ancestry-matched samples without known SARS-CoV-2 infection


## Background

```{r,out.width='50%',out.height='65%'}
include_graphics('../../figures/studydesign.png')
```

- Total of 13 independent genome-wide significant loci associated with COVID-19 (P< 5 × $10^{-8}$/3)

## Methods

- Meta-analysis was done with fixed effects inverse variance weighting.

- Heterogeneity between estimates from contributing studies were tested using Cochran’s Q test

- Each contributing study genotyped the samples and performed quality controls, data imputation and analysis independently, but following consortium recommendations

- GEneralized mixed model (SAIGE) on chromosomes 1-22 and X. The suggested covariates were age, age2, sex, age*sex, and 20 first principal components.



## Additional sensitivity sub-analysis


- hospitalized COVID-19 cases vs non-hospitalized COVID-19 cases n=5,773 and n=15,497 controls

-  showing that
using population controls can be a valid and powerful strategy for host
genetic discovery of infectious disease


## Additional sensitivity sub-analysis

```

## Phenome-wide association

- 9 traits associated with hospitalized COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 reported
infection 

- Two-sample Mendelian randomization revealed 8 exposure — COVID-19 trait-pairs
of a causal association.

- Five of these associations were robust to potential violations of the
underlying assumptions of MR


## Questions

- No summary statistics for all studies (could not find out why). Only available leaving 1 or 2 studies out.

https://www.covid19hg.org/results/r5/

- Which summary statistics to use?

- Which version to use (most recent is r6 but no publication)?
